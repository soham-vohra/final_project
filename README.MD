# Movie Database Schema

## Overview

This is a comprehensive movie rating and tracking database built for Supabase. It aggregates ratings from multiple sources (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, etc.), allows users to rate movies, track watch history, and create custom lists.

## Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables containing user data have RLS enabled to ensure users can only access their own data:

### Public Data (Read-Only for All Users)
- `movies`
- `sources`
- `source_ratings`
- `blend_scores`

### User-Scoped Data
- `profiles` - Users can only view/edit their own profile
- `user_ratings` - Users have full CRUD access to their own ratings
- `watch_history` - Users can view/add/delete their own history (no update)
- `lists` - Users have full CRUD access to their own lists, can view public lists

---

## Foreign Key Relationships

```
movies
  ├─→ source_ratings (ON DELETE CASCADE)
  ├─→ user_ratings (ON DELETE CASCADE)
  ├─→ watch_history (ON DELETE CASCADE)
  ├─→ blend_scores (ON DELETE CASCADE)
  └─→ lists (via movie_ids array)

sources
  └─→ source_ratings (ON DELETE RESTRICT)

auth.users
  └─→ profiles (ON DELETE CASCADE)
       ├─→ user_ratings (ON DELETE CASCADE)
       ├─→ watch_history (ON DELETE CASCADE)
       └─→ lists (ON DELETE CASCADE)
```

## Triggers

### Auto-Update Timestamps
- `movies.updated_at` automatically updates on row modification
- Related data changes (ratings, scores) trigger movie timestamp updates

---

### 3. Create Test Users
- Go to Authentication → Users in Supabase Dashboard
- Add users manually or use the auth API
- Profiles will be created automatically via the auth trigger

### 4. Test RLS Policies
- Created one script that tests reading and inserting to different tables
- To test it, see backend/test_connections.py

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always use UUID for user-related tables** ✓
2. **Use TIMESTAMPTZ for all timestamps** ✓
3. **Enable RLS on user data tables** ✓
4. **Add check constraints for validation** ✓
5. **Index foreign keys and frequently queried columns** ✓
6. **Use CASCADE deletes for dependent data** ✓
7. **Use RESTRICT deletes for reference data** ✓

---

## Notes

- The `window` column in `blend_scores` is quoted because it's a PostgreSQL reserved keyword
- All JSONB columns have GIN indexes for efficient querying
- The schema uses `auth.users` from Supabase's built-in authentication
- RLS policies use `auth.uid()` to identify the current user
- Movie updates automatically trigger timestamp updates via database triggers

# CineSync API

## What it Does
Our API interacts with supabase tables to implement business logic and allows users to update tables where RLS applies. This is done with FastAPI and adds business rules beyond database constraints, combines multiple supbase calls, and creates developer friendly endpoints.

## Setup
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Add `.env` with Supabase credentials
3. `uvicorn main:app --reload`
4. Test at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

## Endpoints (at a minimum)
- `GET /movies` - List all movies
- `POST /movies` - Post new movie 
- `POST /watch_history` - Allows user to add new movie to their watch_history
- `GET /watch_history/count_rewatches` - Retrieves number of times user has watched specified movie
- `POST /user_ratings` - Post for user to input their rating of specified movie

## Key Business Rule
Endpoint 1: Get all movies from movies table
  - Simple get to display all movies in the movies table

Endpoint 2: Post to add movie to movies table
  - Accepts title (string), release_year (int), runtime_minutes (int), content_rating (string), poster_url (string)  as parameters

Endpoint 3: Post to add watched movie by user to watch_history table
  - User inputs a new movie that they watched which will then update the watch_history table for them

Endpoint 4: Get counted number of rewatches in watch_history table
  - Displays number of times a movie has been watched

Endpoint 5: Post for user to input their rating of the movie
  - Allows user to input their perceived score/rating of a movie

## Supabase API Understanding
Supabase API allows simple get and post methods to each table. 
Users are able to access records by querying by any table parameter/column.
Users are able to post to tables with requests containing complete formatted data.
This is inadequate for implementing business logic/math because there is no additional functionality provided.
